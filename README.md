A production-grade implementation of an Investment Portfolio Management System designed to challenge and benchmark Large Language Model (LLM) translation tools, specifically for COBOL modernization efforts.

## Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive COBOL-based system that simulates the complexity of real-world legacy applications. Developed using Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet over five sprints, it serves as a robust test case for evaluating and fine-tuning LLM translation tools aimed at modernizing COBOL codebases.

### Purpose

- **Benchmarking LLMs**: Provides a complex, production-grade COBOL codebase to assess the capabilities of LLMs in translating legacy code to modern languages like Java or C#.
- **COBOL Modernization Reference**: Serves as a detailed example for the COBOL modernization community, addressing the scarcity of publicly available, complex COBOL projects.
- **LLM Development and Testing**: Aids in the development and fine-tuning of LLM translation tools by offering realistic challenges beyond simplistic code snippets.

## Key Features

- **Complex Business Logic**: Implements full transaction processing, portfolio management, and financial calculations.
- **Comprehensive System Architecture**: Includes batch processing, online transaction processing, reporting, utilities, and testing components.
- **Production-Grade Standards**: Follows industry best practices for error handling, data validation, security, and performance optimization.
- **Mainframe Environment Simulation**: Emulates key features of mainframe environments, exercising COBOL and z/OS functionalities.

## High-Level Description

The system simulates an investment portfolio management application that:

- Manages portfolios and transaction histories.
- Processes financial transactions and updates positions.
- Generates reports on positions, audits, and system statistics.
- Supports online inquiries for portfolio positions and transaction histories.

While it is not intended for actual deployment, it mirrors the complexity and structure of real-world COBOL applications found in mainframe environments.

## Development Approach

- **LLM Pair Programming**: Developed collaboratively with Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet, turning requirements into design and code.
- **Five Sprints Execution**: Completed over five development sprints, each focusing on different system components.
- **Best Practices Implementation**: Adheres to standard mainframe development patterns and COBOL coding standards.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Includes detailed documentation to aid understanding and facilitate translation efforts.

## System Architecture Overview

The system comprises several key components:

- **Batch Processing Layer**: Handles transaction validation (`TRNVAL00`), position updates (`POSUPD00`), and history loading (`HISTLD00`).
- **Online Layer**: Provides inquiry capabilities through `INQONLN`, allowing users to view portfolio positions and transaction histories.
- **Utility Programs**: Include file maintenance (`UTLMNT00`), system monitoring (`UTLMON00`), and data validation (`UTLVAL00`).
- **Reporting System**: Generates reports on positions (`RPTPOS00`), audits (`RPTAUD00`), and system statistics (`RPTSTA00`).
- **Test Components**: Consist of test data generation (`TSTGEN00`) and test validation (`TSTVAL00`) to support testing and benchmarking.

## Use in LLM Translation Tools Benchmarking

- **Complexity**: Offers a complex codebase that presents realistic challenges for LLMs, unlike simplistic examples.
- **Variety of Features**: Covers a wide range of COBOL and mainframe features, including VSAM files, DB2 database interactions, CICS transactions, and error handling mechanisms.
- **Benchmark Creation**: Serves as a foundation for creating benchmark translations and training pairs for developing and fine-tuning LLM translation tools.
