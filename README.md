# Investment Portfolio Management System

[![Project Status: Active](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project%20Status-Active-green.svg)]()
[![COBOL](https://img.shields.io/badge/COBOL-Enterprise-blue.svg)]()

A production-grade implementation of an Investment Portfolio Management System created for testing LLM translation of real world legacy applications.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete z/OS COBOL-based portfolio management system, implementing industry-standard patterns and practices. It serves as a reference implementation for:

- Legacy system architecture and design
- COBOL best practices
- Mainframe data handling patterns
- Production-grade error handling and validation

### Key Features

- Portfolio master file management (VSAM KSDS)
- Transaction processing
- Financial calculations and balance management
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- DB2 database integration

## Development Approach

This project is being developed through LLM pair programming, specifically using Claude 3.5 Sonnet. The development process:

1. Uses standard mainframe development patterns
2. Implements full error handling and validation
3. Includes comprehensive documentation
4. Follows industry best practices for COBOL development

## Development Status

Currently in active development:

- Sprint 0: âœ… Complete (Technical Setup)
- Sprint 1: ðŸš§ In Progress (Core Portfolio Management)

## Purpose

This project serves as a comprehensive example of how Large Language Models can assist in understanding, documenting, and potentially translating legacy mainframe applications. It provides a complete, working example of a production-grade COBOL application with all the complexity and patterns typically found in real-world systems.

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is provided:

- [System Architecture Document (SAD)](documentation/system-architecture.md) detailing the technical design
- [Data Dictionary](documentation/data-dictionary.md) defining all data structures
- [Development Backlog](documentation/development-backlog.md)
- [Test Data Specifications](documentation/test-data-specs.md)

## Technical Standards

- Enterprise COBOL for z/OS compliance
- Standard z/OS file handling patterns
- DB2 for z/OS SQL standards
- z/OS batch processing best practices
- Mainframe security standards
- Standard JCL conventions

## Quality Standards

All code in this repository:

- Follows z/OS development best practices
- Includes complete error handling
- Implements standard checkpoint/restart patterns
- Contains production-ready JCL
- Includes comprehensive copybooks
- Follows DB2 for z/OS standards
