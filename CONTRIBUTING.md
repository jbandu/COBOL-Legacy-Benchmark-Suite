2. **Format Requirements**

   ```cobol
   000000* Column standards
   000000 01  VARIABLE-NAMES-SHOULD-BE.
   000000     05  CLEAR-AND-DESCRIPTIVE     PIC X(10).
   000000     05  FOLLOW-NAMING-CONVENTIONS PIC 9(05).
   ```

3. **Coding Patterns**
   - Use level 88 conditions appropriately
   - Follow copybook organization standards
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Use structured programming techniques

### Documentation Standards

1. **Technical Documentation**

   - Use clear, concise language
   - Include code examples
   - Document all assumptions
   - Explain business context

2. **Test Documentation**
   - Define test objectives
   - List expected results
   - Include test data samples
   - Document validation steps
