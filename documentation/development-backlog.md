## Overview

This backlog outlines the implementation plan for the Investment Portfolio Management System. The code developed will be production-grade COBOL designed for z/OS execution, following mainframe development best practices and standards. While the implementation won't have access to a z/OS environment for testing, all code will be written to production standards and be ready for z/OS deployment.
