## Overview

This backlog outlines the implementation plan for the Investment Portfolio Management System. The code developed will be production-grade COBOL designed for z/OS execution, following mainframe development best practices and standards. While the implementation won't have access to a z/OS environment for testing, all code will be written to production standards and be ready for z/OS deployment.

## Sprint 0 (Foundation) - Current Sprint

**Goal**: Establish development foundation and core infrastructure components

### Technical Setup Tasks

1. Set up development environment

   - Configure COBOL development tooling
   - Set up source control repository
   - Establish code review process
   - Document compile and link requirements

2. Create program templates

   - Standard z/OS COBOL program structure
   - VSAM and sequential file handling
   - Standard error handling patterns
   - DB2 interaction patterns

3. Establish test data specifications
   - File record examples
   - Test case specifications
   - Data validation criteria

### Core Infrastructure Tasks

1. Implement core data structures

   - VSAM file definitions
   - DB2 table interfaces
   - Standard copybooks
   - Return code handling

2. Create copybook libraries

   - TRNREC (Transaction Record)
   - POSREC (Position Record)
   - HISTREC (History Record)
   - Common field definitions

3. Establish batch control framework
   - Checkpoint/restart logic
   - Error handling routines
   - Process logging standards

### Documentation Tasks

1. Document z/OS environment requirements
2. Create COBOL coding standards
3. Establish testing requirements
4. Document compile and deployment procedures

## Implementation Scope

### Deliverables

- Production-ready COBOL programs
- JCL for deployment and execution
- Complete copybook libraries
- DB2 DDL and DML
- Deployment documentation

### Technical Standards

- COBOL code compatible with Enterprise COBOL for z/OS
- Standard z/OS file handling patterns
- DB2 for z/OS SQL standards
- z/OS batch processing patterns

### Quality Assurance

- Code review against mainframe standards
- Static analysis of COBOL code
- SQL review for DB2 compatibility
- JCL validation
